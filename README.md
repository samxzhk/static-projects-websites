# Welcome to my repository

This repository is all about the core concept of git and github - upload and keep track of your precious code ( well, you could say like that )
<br>

In this repo I'll be constantly posting static websites/cards/components or other kind of stuffy related to html and css that I'll eventually make while watching coding videos or completing tasks/challenges.
<br>

It's just for practice purpose and to keep a sharp look at my progress over the time 

Really, nothing interesting  :)
